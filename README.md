## Project Structure

## How to Use the Project
1. **Download the `.pbix` file** and open it in Power BI.
2. **View the Dashboard**: Explore the interactive visualizations to gain insights into diversity and inclusion metrics.
3. **Adjust filters**: Use Power BI filters to dive deeper into specific departments, roles, or time periods.

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Gender Balance at Executive Levels**: The dashboard highlights a slower rate of improvement in achieving gender diversity at the executive level. Potential causes include limited promotion opportunities and biased hiring processes. Targeted leadership programs and diversity-driven recruitment may help address this issue.
- **Departmental Disparities**: Certain departments have a noticeable gender imbalance, particularly in STEM fields. Encouraging more inclusive hiring practices and mentorship programs could help reduce these disparities.
- **Addressing the Gender Pay Gap**: Pay gaps at different levels of the organization need attention. Regular audits and transparency in compensation policies can help bridge these gaps.
